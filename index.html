<p>Notice</p>  <hr /> <p>  <center><strong>Legal Hold Subject Matter</strong></center><p>There are three general subject matter categories for which you are instructed to preserve all, and
not to alter any, Information as that term is defined below which includes electronically stored
information such as emails.</p><p><u><strong>McKinsey & Company and Outsourcing Food/EVS Programs</strong></u></p><ul><li>In or around mid-2012, Dignity Health hired McKinsey & Company (“<strong>McKinsey</strong>”) as a
consultant to evaluate potential improvement opportunities including the outsourcing
certain services.</li><li>McKinsey worked with Dignity Health’s Purchased Services, Supply & Service
Resource Management (“<strong>SSRM</strong>”) to request proposals for the management of Dignity
Health’s environmental, or janitorial, services program for each of the facilities in the
Sacramento Region. Crothall Healthcare’s (“<strong>Crothall</strong>”) proposal was ultimately
selected.</li><li>In November of 2012, Dignity Health/SSRM and Crothall entered into a Master Services
Agreement for the management of Dignity Health’s environmental program in the
Sacramento Region (the “<strong>Crothall Contract</strong>”).</li><li>Around the same time, mid to late 2012, McKinsey worked with Dignity Health to
expand the outsourcing of <i>both</i> the food and environmental services programs to all of
the facilities, on a system wide basis, through another request for proposals.</li><li>Aramark’s proposal was ultimately selected. McKinsey helped structure Dignity
Health’s contract with Aramark contract, also known as a Master Services Agreement
(the “<strong>Aramark Contract</strong>”), by developing certain financial and service level guaranties.</li></ul> 
<p><strong>You are required to preserve and not alter Information as defined below (including
electronically stored information like emails) related or connected in any way to what is
generally described above including Dignity Health’s relationship with McKinsey, and
particularly any work related to the initiatives that resulted in the requests for proposal
which resulted in the Crothall Contract and the Aramark Contract.
</strong></p>
<p><u><strong>Crothall Healthcare, Crothall Contract, and Outsourcing of EVS Program</strong></u></p>
<ul><li>Related to the above, in November of 2012 Dignity Health/SSRM entered into the
Master Services Agreement with Crothall Healthcare (again, the “<strong>Crothall Contract</strong>”).</li></ul><p>Notice</p><hr /><ul><li>Under the Crothall Contract, Crothall managed Dignity Health’s environmental services
programs for all facilities in the Sacramento Region. The Crothall Contract was
terminated in mid-2013.</li><li>In June of 2013, Dignity Health/SSRM entered into a similar contract for the
management of <i>both</i> its food and environmental services programs with Aramark (again,
the “<strong>Aramark Contract</strong>”).</li></ul>
<p><strong>You are required to preserve and not alter Information as defined below (including
electronically stored information like emails) related or connected in any way to what is
generally described above including Dignity Health’s relationship with Crothall and the
Crothall Contract, particularly including any work related to the expansion of this
outsourcing initiative outside of the Sacramento Region to ultimately include both the food
and environmental programs under the Aramark Contract.</strong></p>
<u><strong>Aramark, Aramark Contract, and Financial and Service Level Guarantees</strong></u><ul><li>In June of 2013, following a request for proposals and bidding process with McKinsey’s
assistance, and based in part on the positive aspects of the Crothall Contract, Dignity
Health/SSRM and Aramark entered into a Master Services Agreement for the
management of its food and environmental programs on a system wide basis (again, the
“<strong>Aramark Contract</strong>”).</li>
<li>The Aramark Contract was intended to standardize the delivery of the food and
environmental programs on a system wide basis and to increase the quality, while
reducing the costs, of those programs by setting certain financial and service level
guarantees, or “targets.”</li>
<li>McKinsey assisted Dignity Health/SSRM with the formulation, among other things, of
formulas for the financial guarantees (involving a “Cost Net of Cash per Patient
Guarantee” and “EVS Cost per Adjusted Admission Guarantee”) and the service level
guarantees (involving “Avatar” and “HCAHPS” scores) in the Aramark Contract.</li>
<li>Aramark’s performance was to be measured by the comparison and reconciliation of the
differences, if any, between the actual costs and service levels for the food and
environmental programs and the financial and service level guarantees in the Aramark
Contract.</li>
<li>Aramark may contend that any differences between the actual costs and service levels
for the food and environmental programs and the financial and service level guarantees in the Aramark Contract are due to variances or exceptions that were approved by Dignity
Health administrators at the local, or facility, level.</li></ul>
<p>Notice</p><hr /><ul><li>The Aramark Contract will expire at the end of June, and the programs will return to
internal management. </li></ul><p><strong>You are required to preserve and not alter Information (including electronically stored
information like emails) related or connected in any way to what is generally described
above including Dignity Health’s relationship with Aramark and the Aramark Contract,
particularly including financial and service level guarantees, and potential variances from
or exceptions to those guarantees.</strong></p><u><strong>Policies and Procedures Developed Solely by Aramark or Jointly by Aramark and Dignity
Health, or by DI Solutions</strong></u><ul><li>Throughout the term of the Aramark Contract, various policies and procedures were
implemented within the FNS and EVS departments at Dignity Health facilities. Any
policy or procedure that was developed solely by Aramark, either before or during the
Aramark Contract, and that was implemented by Aramark while the Aramark Contract
was in effect, is an “<strong>Aramark Policy</strong>.”</li><li>Also throughout the term of the Aramark Contract, Aramark and Dignity Health “jointly
developed” and implemented a number of additional policies and procedures. Any policy
or procedure that was jointly developed and implemented by Aramark and Dignity Health
while the Aramark Contract was in effect is a “<strong>Joint Policy</strong>.” By “jointly developed,”
we mean a policy or procedure which can be shown to be the result of collaboration, with
each side making material contributions.</li><li>After termination of the Aramark Contract, Deisell Martinez of DI Solutions, Inc.
(“<strong>Martinez</strong>”) worked with various Dignity Health personnel to develop a set of Standard
Operating Procedures (“<strong>Martinez SOPs</strong>”). The Martinez SOPs bear DI Solutions’
name.</li>
<li>Aramark has alleged that Dignity Health improperly continued to use Aramark Policies
after termination of the Aramark Contract and provided one example, which appeared to
be a Martinez SOP.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You are required to preserve and not alter Information (including electronically stored
information like emails) related or connected in any way to what is generally described</strong></p><p>Notice</p><hr /><p><strong>above, including Dignity Health’s collaboration with Aramark or DI Solutions with respect
to developing any Joint Policy or Martinez SOP, and Dignity Health’s use or
implementation of any Aramark Policy, Joint Policy, or Martinez SOP, either while the
Aramark Contract was in effect or since its termination. </strong></p>
<center><u><strong>Legal Hold Period</strong></u></center><p>The preservation period for the Information (defined below) is January 1, 2012 through
present. </p><center><u><strong>Legal Hold Obligation and FAQs</strong></u></center><p><strong>“Legal Hold”</strong> is a process that an organization uses to preserve and protect all relevant forms of
potential Information (documents or materials) when a claim, investigation or litigation is
reasonably anticipated, regardless of whether it is favorable or adverse to Dignity Health.</p>
<p><strong>What does this request require me to do?</strong> For now, as a Custodian of such Information, you
must protect and preserve all Information in your possession or control, including those held by
a vendor or consultant. <strong><u>DO NOT</u></strong> destroy, delete, alter, move or modify any such documents or
materials in any form or media, regardless of whether it supports or undermines Dignity
Health’s position. You must preserve such documents and materials until notified otherwise by
Dignity Health’s EDIG Team. <strong>WHEN IN DOUBT, KEEP the document OR CONSULT the legal
counsel requesting this Legal Hold as identified in the Case Summary (above). “If it exists: it
persists” – no modification or deletion.</strong></p><p><strong>How do I preserve Information?</strong> Hold—do not destroy, delete, alter, move or modify — any
Information in your (Dignity Health’s) possession, custody or control.</p><p><strong>What is considered “Information”?</strong> For purposes of this Notice, Information should be
interpreted by you in the broadest sense to include but not be limited to hard copy and
any electronically stored information (<strong>ESI</strong>) (whether on a server, your computer(s), CDs, DVDs,
cellular telephone/smartphone, tablet computer or removable drives, and regardless of any file
format) or hard copy (whether in your office or elsewhere that might be relevant to this Legal
Hold Notice). Information also includes, but is not limited to: email, chat, text messages,
Sharepoint, WorkFront, Box, any other platform, videos, recordings on cameras, instant
messaging, databases, MS Word files, MS Excel Spreadsheets, MS PowerPoint presentations,
MS Access, log files, and programming code, and any other ESI. This preservation includes each
and every copy of any <strong>ESI</strong> or hard copy of any such Information in Dignity Health’s possession,</p><p>Notice</p><hr /><p>and in your possession or control, including any personally-owned devices that may contain
Information. See above for the date range of the Information to be preserved.</p><p><strong>What is meant by “Hold—Do Not Destroy, Delete, Alter, Move or Modify”?</strong> Essentially, you
may not delete, move or otherwise change any file covered by this Notice. If you need to use a
particular file, it is best that you make a copy first and use the copy. Effective immediately, you
must preserve and retain any hard copy or <strong>ESI</strong> (defined above) or data that is or may be
relevant or related to this Notice. Dignity Health is legally required to preserve and to use
reasonable means to prevent destroying, altering, deleting, overwriting or otherwise modifying
any such Information, whether hard copy or digital.</p><p><strong>How important is this to Dignity Health?</strong> This is an extremely important legal responsibility,
both for Dignity Health and for you individually. Failing to follow the guidelines set forth in this
Notice may result in legal sanctions against Dignity Health and even the Custodian.</p><p><strong>What should I do next?</strong> Sit tight – and don’t worry. Do not take any actions to organize your
Information – do not worry about how this impacts your daily routine – it really shouldn’t. In
the end, it is quite simple – if you are in doubt, don’t modify, access or delete any Information.
We would rather you err on the side of caution than accidentally or unintentionally delete or
modify any Information. The relevance of your information will be determined by the EDIG
team.</p><p><strong>What should you do if you have any questions? If you still have questions upon completion of
the below, complete Questions no. 7 below.</strong></p><p>Again, if you are unsure whether Information or device you have is subject to this Notice,
